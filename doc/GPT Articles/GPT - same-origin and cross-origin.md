**Same-origin** and **cross-origin** are concepts related to web security that define how resources (such as scripts, images, and data) are accessed between different websites or domains. These concepts are crucial in implementing the **Same-Origin Policy (SOP)**, a fundamental security mechanism in web browsers.

### Same-Origin

**Same-origin** refers to a scenario where two URLs or resources share the same **origin**. An origin is defined by three components:

1. **Scheme (Protocol)**: The protocol used, such as `http`, `https`, `ftp`, etc.
2. **Host (Domain)**: The domain name or IP address.
3. **Port**: The port number used by the server (default ports are typically 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS).

For two URLs to be considered **same-origin**, all three of these components must match exactly.

#### Example:

Consider the following URLs:

- `http://example.com/page1.html`
- `http://example.com/page2.html`

These two URLs have the same origin because:

- **Scheme**: `http`
- **Host**: `example.com`
- **Port**: (implicitly) 80 (default for HTTP)

In contrast, these URLs are **different origins**:

- `http://example.com:8080/page.html` (different port)
- `https://example.com/page.html` (different scheme)
- `http://another-example.com/page.html` (different host)

### Cross-Origin

**Cross-origin** refers to a scenario where two URLs or resources have different origins. This means that at least one of the three origin components (scheme, host, or port) differs between the two resources.

#### Example:

- `http://example.com/page1.html` and `http://another-example.com/page2.html` are cross-origin because they have different hosts.
- `http://example.com/page.html` and `https://example.com/page.html` are cross-origin because they have different schemes.
- `http://example.com/page.html` and `http://example.com:8080/page.html` are cross-origin because they use different ports.

### Same-Origin Policy (SOP)

The **Same-Origin Policy (SOP)** is a critical security measure implemented in web browsers. It restricts how scripts, iframes, and resources from one origin can interact with resources from another origin. The main goal of SOP is to protect sensitive data by preventing potentially malicious websites from accessing information from other sites.

#### Under SOP:
- Scripts running on a web page from `http://example.com` cannot access data from `http://another-example.com`.
- SOP applies to cookies, local storage, IndexedDB, DOM access, and other web technologies.

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

To allow controlled access to resources between different origins, the **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** mechanism is used. CORS is a protocol that allows servers to specify who can access their resources from another origin.

- CORS headers are sent by the server, indicating which domains are allowed to access the resources.
- CORS is typically used to allow web APIs to be accessed across different domains.

#### Example of CORS:

A server might respond with the following headers to allow cross-origin access:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://another-example.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT
```

This allows the `another-example.com` domain to make GET, POST, and PUT requests to the server.

### Summary

- **Same-origin**: Two URLs have the same origin if they share the same scheme, host, and port.
- **Cross-origin**: Two URLs are cross-origin if they differ in any of the origin components (scheme, host, port).
- **Same-Origin Policy (SOP)**: A security mechanism that restricts interactions between different origins to protect sensitive data.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: A protocol that allows controlled access to resources across different origins, enabling cross-origin requests when needed.
